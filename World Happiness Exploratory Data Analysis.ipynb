    "* The happiness scores and rankings use data from the Gallup World Poll.\n",
    "    * Gallup World Poll: In 2005, Gallup began its World Poll, which continually surveys citizens in 160 countries, representing more than 98% of the world's adult population. The Gallup World Pool consist of more than 100 global questions as well as region -specific items.\n",
    "* The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors - economic predudction, socia support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity - contribute to making life evaultaions higher in each country than they are in Dystopia, a hypothetical country that has values equal to the world's lowest national averages for each of the siz factors:\n",
    "* **Ladder Score:** Happines score or subjective well-being. This is the national average response to the question of life evaulations.\n",
    "* **Logged GDP per capita:** The GDP-pec-capita time series from 2019 to 2020 using countryspecific forecasts of real GDP growth in 2020.\n",
    "* **Social Support:** Social Support refers to assistance of support provided by members of social networks to an individual.\n",
    "* **Health life expectancy:** Health life expectancy is the average life in good health - thaht is to say without irreversible limitation of activity in daily life or incapacities - of a fictitious generation subject to the conditions of mortality and morbidity prevailing that year.\n",
    "* **Freedom to make life choices:** Freedom to make life choices is the national average of binary responses to the GWP question \"Are you satisfied or dissatisfied with your freedom to choose what yo do with your life?\" ...It is defined as the average of laughter and enjoyment for other waves there the happiness question was not asked.\n",
    "* **Generosity:** Generosity is the rasidual of regressing national average of responses to the GWP question \"Have you donated money to a charity in the past month?\" on GDP per capita.\n",
    "* **Perceptions of corruption:** The measure is the national average of the survey responses to two questions in the GWP: \"Is corruption widespread throughout the government or not\" and \"Is corruption widespread within businesses or not?\"\n",
    "* **Ladder score in Dystopia:** It has values equal to the world's lowest national averages. Dystopia as benchmark against which to compare contributions from each of the six factors. Dystopia is an imaginary country that has the world's least-happy people. ...Since life would be very unpleasant in a country with the world's lowest incomes, lowest life expectancy, lowest generosity, most corruption, least freedom, and least social support, it is referred to as 'Dystopia' in contrast to Utopia."
